#Virtual-AudioBook

This is a JavaScript AudioBook.
The goal is to learn how certain objects are named in english.
There are three chapters with objects from three different fields: Animals, Vechicles and Weather.
When the user clicks on the icons, a sound is played that contains the pronunciation of the corresponding english word.
When the back button is clicked, the user is returned to the initial menu where you can select another chapter.

There are four HTML pages, the main menu and the three chapters, connected through event listeners for the buttons.
